Much faith is placed in the belief that wealth creation from new technologies will sustain economic growth.
How robust is the process that drives innovation in new software products? Many enterprise software products once
originated in the R&D labs of large corporations such as Bell Labs, IBM, and Xerox.

<h4>Early Model</h4>

This model has evolved into the multi-party process that is common today:

<h4>Common Model Today</h4>

</div>

1. A startup, driven by the vision of its founders, and unencumbered by the prospect of cannibalizing
existing products or services, sets out to create a new product or market. Innovation is fostered by having
a clear vision, a tight-knit team, and the motivation to target sacred cows or customer complaints for which
incumbents have been too slow to address or have actively downplayed because of vested interests.
2. The startup attracts the talent to develop a product but often lacks the scale to market, sell, and support it.
It may also lack the funds to get the product to market.
3. Early stage investors - Angels, Incubators, Venture Capitalists - provide seed funding in return for a stake
in the company. This seed capital helps prove the market viability of the product and to acquire the crucial initial
customers.
4. Some of these companies may receive additional rounds of venture capital to build their own marketing and sales
channels and attempt to go it alone. But most will be acquired by an established company looking to fill out their
product strategy with the technology and accounts, which the acquired company brings.

In effect, the large corporations who once conducted their R&D in-house, have now outsourced their R&D whereby the
risk can be syndicated and they avoid the challenges of attracting and motivating talent, and of trying to manage
an innovative culture within the confines of compliance and business-as-usual imperatives.

A number of arguments have been made against this model:

* The involvement of more parties means that returns are more widely shared although this
cost must be balanced against the benefit of risk reduction.
* It favours shorter term investments, which consequently limits scope for integration and creation of
fundamentally new markets. That is, we create ever more inventive ways to advertise against, for example,
missions to Mars or safe fusion reactors.

Another argument against the current model is that while there have been benefits to vendors,
investors, and startups; I am not sure how customers of enterprise software have substantially gained from it.
Either they must take a chance with a new company, that they will have longer term support options, or
must take a number from a full service vendor, depending on the size of their spend, whereby it is frequently
difficult to get straight information about products and pricing without going through a sales layer.
Of course relationships do count, but this serves neither party if a solution is not the right fit for a given
problem and a sizable budget has to be committed just to get to a proof of concept.

A fundamental change I see to this Software Innovation Value Chain is in using open source projects and the ecosystems that
evolve around them as an alternate channel to disseminate product information and for organizations to more fully
evaluate solutions prior to committing to funding and delivery.

<h4>An Emerging Model</h4>

This model involves:

1. Releasing the core product as an open source project, which allows potential customers to examine the product
in detail, assess its quality, leverage the free support that exists in the community, and trial a solution
within their environment before having to commit to big budgets and risking reputations.
2. The users of the product become the product advocates.
3. The product creator builds a business model based on services and/or add-on products which provide additional enterprise
capabilities on top of the core product.

The potential benefits to the customer are:

* More choice in support options, pricing, and partners
* Improved interoperability of solutions using open standards
* Greater transparency of the technical merit and fit of products
* Ability to evaluate the technology and prove solutions free of pressure tactics
