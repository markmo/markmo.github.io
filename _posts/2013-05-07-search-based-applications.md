What if the familiar search box could be used to access all enterprise information, not only web content and documents, but also business intelligence (BI) reports and data from the customer relationship management (CRM) system, and join the information together to provide insight where the sum of information is greater than from individual data marts, spreadsheets and document repositories? Search and BI are converging.

A big deal is made about the differences between structured and unstructured information. In reality, all information exists in various states of structure. Some information stored in a database is held in free text fields as notes and comments or because the source system didn’t provide strong validation. A lot of “unstructured data” has structure in the form of metadata and predictable formatting, which can be used to extract structured data. Text analytics can be applied to documents to extract entities such as people and company names, locations, and topics.

In addition, numeric data does not represent the total sum of relevant information. Relevant information includes textual analysis, news, and other contextual information that adds meaning to numbers. A Search Based Application (SBA) is a tool to bring together all relevant information for a given inquiry.

Search Based Applications utilise search and data integration technologies, and complement traditional BI tools, to:

* Provide access to enterprise information that everyone can use – increasing the value of BI by opening up access to vetted reports to a wider audience
* Find all the relevant information for a given inquiry, including the estimated 75-85% of information that doesn’t reside in a corporate database
* Increase the insight from numbers when presented alongside contextual information with analytical tools to chart, map and dissect the data
* Integrate relevant data gleaned from sources outside transactional processing systems including public web data such as that supplied by social media monitoring
* Alert users of changes to information pertaining to topics of interest, reducing the reaction time of the organisation to important events

Providing the right level of information and functionality to create a killer SBA requires an understanding of how information is being used in a business context. And to enable the kinds of joins between structured and unstructured data as described above, requires essential pre-work in information architecture and taxonomy development. However, it is possible to deliver solutions iteratively, providing quick wins and building momentum and support to implement game-changing information systems. For example, the approach taken by Google OneBox, might be a simple first step towards creating <a href="http://www.cio.com/article/602364/Five_Advantages_of_Unified_Information_Access_UIA" target="_blank">Unified Information Access</a> (UIA). The concept is that keywords matching a specified pattern will trigger pulling structured data into search results e.g. customer account information in response to a query using the customer’s name. The best approach to implementing UIA will vary across search vendors.

Imagine near instant recall of that proposal you wrote last year, arranged next to what people are saying about a target account in the social media, and historical sales information for that account, obtained with same ease of use that you would “Google it” at home. That vision is a step closer to true business intelligence.
